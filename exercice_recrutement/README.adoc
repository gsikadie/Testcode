= Java/Scala Play! exam

== Overview

For this exam you will be building a backend for a new feature of the Discount Ascii Warehouse
ecommerce platform.

Your application will produce a list of "Popular purchases", so customers can see who else
bought the same products as them. To complete the exam your application will need to accept
HTTP requests to /api/recent_purchases/:username​ and respond with a list of recently
purchased products, and the names of other users who recently purchased them.

There is no frontend component to this exam, you're just building the backend.

== Other requirements

* your application must cache API requests so that it can respond as quickly as possible.
* if a username is provided that cannot be found, the API should respond with ​ "User with
username of '{{username}}' was not found"

== Where does the data come from?

Data about users, products and purchases is available to you via an external API. You can make
requests like this: `curl http://74.50.59.155:6000/api/users`

A full API reference is in README.md into the zip attached.

To work out the "Popular purchases":

* fetch 5 recent purchases for the user: ​ GET /api/purchases/by_user/:username?limit=5
* for each of those products, get a list of all people who previously purchased that
product: ​ GET /api/purchases/by_product/:product_id
* at the same time, request info about the products: ​ GET /api/products/:product_id
* finally, put all of the data together and sort it so that the product with the highest
number of recent purchases is first.

Example response:
```
[
 {
  "id": 555622,
  "face": " 。◕‿◕。 ",
  "price": 1100,
  "size": 27,
  "recent": [
   "Frannie79",
   "Barney_Bins18",
   "Hortense6",
   "Melvina84"
  ]
 },
...
]
```

== What to include in your solution

Your solution should be a zipped (or gzipped) archive including:
* a git archive of all source code required to run the application
* step-by-step instructions for the reviewer to follow so that they can run your
application.
* any other notes or rationale you think is helpful for the reviewer to consider when
grading your solution.
